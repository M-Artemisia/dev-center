Every algorithm on Algorithmia has a dedicated git repository. This allows you to seamlessly integrate Algorithmia with your current workflows,
such as your code editor, IDE, or deployment pipelines.

## Accessing a repository

You can clone existing algorithms from the following endpoint:
{% highlight bash %}
    git clone https://git.algorithmia.com/git/:username/:algoname.git
{% endhighlight %}

Replace the `:username` and `:algoname` portions with the currect values, case sensitive.

## Committing changes to an algorithm

You can apply your changes and push them as usual.
{% highlight bash %}
git commit -a -m "Note on changes goes here"
git push
{% endhighlight %}

Everything will behave as a normal git repository, with the additional last line that will point you to a private REST API endpoint.

{% highlight bash %}
Remote: build successful for algo://:username/:algoname/:hash
{% endhighlight %}

The REST API endpoint is a live version of the latest build of your algorithm (previous versions are still available). It behaves exactly as a published algorithm 
except for the fact that it is not listed in the marketplace and will only accept calls from your API keys. This is a great way 
to run regression tests against an algorithm before making it available to others.

## Testing your changes 

With the private REST API endpoint in hand, you can run your unit tests against it or manually test that algorithm from the command 
line using the <a href="https://github.com/algorithmiaio/algorithmia-cli">Algorithmia CLI</a>. Testing using the CLI will be
something similar to:
{% highlight bash %}
algo run :username/:algoname/:hash -d "<JSON_INPUT>"
{% endhighlight %}

See the <a href="https://github.com/algorithmiaio/algorithmia-cli">Algorithmia CLI</a> for more options.

## Managing branches

Branches are allowed and will be accepted in pushes, however Algorithmia will not compile branches other than master.

Algorithmia will only compile the head of the master branch on each push. It will not compile intermediate commits 
if they are all pushed together as a batch. Finally, Algorithmia will reject any push which contains non-fast-forward commits. 
This is to prevent changing the history of an algorithm, and potentially breaking Algorithmia's versioning.

## Initializing a repository

As of today, you will need to manually create an algorithm from the web interface, which will `git init` a repository. Once a 
repository is initialized, you can clone it as shown above. The web interface is currently necessary in order to specify name
and permissions of an algorithm.
