This guide provides a walk-through of how to use the official Algorithmia R client to call algorithms and manage your data through the Algorithmia platform.

## Install from Cran

The official Algorithmia R client is available on Cran and includes links to vignettes and the reference manual at: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/algorithmia/index.html">Algorithmia on Cran</a>

Open up the R shell and type:

{% highlight r %}
install.packages("algorithmia")
{% endhighlight %}

## Authentication

First, create an Algorithmia client and authenticate with your API key:

{% highlight r %}
import Algorithmia

apiKey = '{Your API key here}'
client = getAlgorithmiaClient(apiKey)
{% endhighlight %}

Now you’re ready to call algorithms.

## Calling algorithms

The following examples of calling algorithms are organized by type of input/output which vary between algorithms.

**Note:** A single algorithm may have different input and output types, or accept multiple types of input, so consult the algorithm’s description for usage examples specific to that algorithm.

### Text input/output

Call an algorithm with text input by simply passing a string into its pipe method. If the algorithm output is text, then the result field of the response will be a string.

{% highlight r %}
algo = client$algo('demo/Hello/0.1.1')
response = algo$pipe("World")$result
{% endhighlight %}

This example code will return:
{% highlight r %}
[1] "Hello World"
{% endhighlight %}

### JSON input/output

Call an algorithm with JSON input by simply passing in a type that can be serialized to JSON: most notably R lists and arrays. For algorithms that return JSON, the result field of the response will be the appropriate deserialized type.

{% highlight r %}
algo = client$algo('WebPredict/ListAnagrams/0.1.0')
input = list("transformer", "terraforms", "retransform")
response = algo$pipe(input)$result
{% endhighlight %}

This list input returns a list of anagrams:
{% highlight r %}
[[1]]
[1] "transformer"

[[2]]
[1] "retransform"
{% endhighlight %}

### Binary input/output

Call an algorithm with Binary input by passing a raw vector into the pipe method. Similarly, if the algorithm response is binary data, then the result field of the response will be a raw vector.

{% highlight r %}
input = 'https://stopthehitch.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/arnold-schwarzenegger-1920x1080.jpg'
algo = client$algo("opencv/SmartThumbnail/0.1")
response = algo$pipe(input)$result
# -> [raw vector]
{% endhighlight %}

## Request options

The client exposes options that can configure algorithm requests. This includes support for changing the timeout or indicating that the API should include stdout in the response.

{% highlight r %}
response = client$algo('util/echo')$set_options(timeout=60, stdout=False)
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:** stdout=True is only supported if you have access to the algorithm source.

## Working with data

The Algorithmia client also provides a way to manage both Algorithmia hosted data and data from Dropbox or S3 accounts that you’ve connected to you Algorithmia account.

### Create directories

Create directories by instantiating a DataDirectory object and calling create():

{% highlight r %}
client$dir("data://.my/demo")$create()
client$dir("dropbox://somefolder")$create()
{% endhighlight %}

### Upload files to a directory

Upload files by calling put on a DataFile object, or by calling putFile on a DataDirectory object.

{% highlight r %}
demo = client$dir("data://.my/demo")
demo$putFile("/path/to/myfile")
# $put can take integer or string data
demo$file("sample.txt")$put("sample text contents")
demo$file("binary_file")$put(some_binary_data)
{% endhighlight %}

Note: you can instantiate a DataFile by either client$file(path) or client$dir(path)$file(filename)

### Download contents of file

Download files by calling getString, getBytes, getJson, or getFile on a DataFile object:

{% highlight r %}
demo = client$dir("data://.my/demo")
sampleText = demo$file("sample.txt")$getString()  # String object
binaryContent = demo$file("binary_file")$getBytes()  # Binary data
tempFile = demo$file("myfile")$getFile()   # Open file descriptor
{% endhighlight %}

### Delete files and directories

Delete files and directories by calling delete on their respective DataFile or DataDirectory object. DataDirectories take an optional force parameter that indicates whether the directory should be deleted if it contains files or other directories.

{% highlight r %}
demo = client$dir("data://.my/demo")
demo$file("sample.txt")$delete()
demo$delete(true) // true implies force deleting the directory and its contents
{% endhighlight %}

### List directory contents

Iterate over the contents of a directory using the iterated returned by calling list, files, or dirs on a DataDirectory object:

{% highlight r %}
# Create an AlgorithmiaDataDirectory class
demo = client$dir("data://.my/demo")
{% endhighlight %}

### List files in "demo"
{% highlight r %}
# AlgorithmiaDataDirectory class
demo = client$dir("data://.my/demo")

# Creates an AlgorithmiaDirectoryIterator of all the child files
files = demo$files()
paste(files$getNext()$dataFileUrl, files$getNext()$last_modified)
{% endhighlight %}

#### List directories in "demo"
{% highlight r %}
# Get everything in demo
dirs = demo$dirs()
# Check for next directory in demo
dirs$hasNext()
# Get next directory in demo
dirs$getNext()
# To get path and url for all directories
dirs$dataDirectory
{% endhighlight %}

### Manage directory permissions

Directory permissions may be set when creating a directory, or may be updated on already existing directories.

{% highlight r %}
demo = client$dir("data://.my/demo")
# ReadAcl$PUBLIC is a wrapper for Acl(AclType$PUBLIC) to make things easier
demo$create(ReadAcl.PUBLIC)
acl = demo$get_permissions()  # Acl object
acl$read_acl == AclType$PUBLIC  # True

demo$updatePermissions(ReadAcl$PRIVATE)
demo$get_permissions()$read_acl == AclType$PRIVATE # True
{% endhighlight %}
