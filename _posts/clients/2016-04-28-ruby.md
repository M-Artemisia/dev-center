This guide provides a walk-through of how to use the official Algorithmia Ruby client to call algorithms and manage your data
through the Algorithmia platform.

Here you will learn how to install the Algorithmia Ruby Client, work with the Data API by uploading and downloading files, create and update directories and permission types and last, you'll learn how to call an algorithm that summarizes text files.

To follow along you can create a new Ruby script or if you'd rather, you can follow the examples in the Ruby interpreter.

For more information on the methods available using the Data API in Ruby check out the [Data API](http://docs.algorithmia.com/) or the [Algorithmia Ruby Client](https://github.com/algorithmiaio/algorithmia-ruby.git)


## Getting Started with Algorithmia

The Algorithmia Ruby Client is available on rubygems. Simply add gem 'algorithmia' to your application’s Gemfile and run bundle install or install via:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem install algorithmia
{% endhighlight %}

## Authentication

Next, retrieve your API key from the Credentials tab under "My Profile" after you've logged in to [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/).

Now import the Algorithmia library and create the Algorithmia client, passing in your API key that you got from the Credentials tab found in "My Profile":

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'algorithmia'

# Authenticate with your API key
apiKey = '{Your API key here}'
# Create the Algorithmia client object
client = Algorithmia.client(apiKey)
{% endhighlight %}

Now you’re ready to start working with Algorithmia in Ruby.

## Working with Data Using the Data API

For application developers, [Algorithmia's Data Portal](http://developers.algorithmia.com/application-development/data-sources/) offers three different ways to store your data, all available via the [Data API](http://docs.algorithmia.com/).

This guide will show how to work with the [Hosted Data](https://algorithmia.com/data/hosted) option on the Algorithmia platform which is available to both algorithm and application developers.

### Prerequisites
If you wish to follow along working through the example yourself, create a text file that contains any unstructured text such as a chapter from a public domain book or article. We used a chapter from [Burning Daylight, by Jack London](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Burning_Daylight) which you can copy and paste into a text file. Or copy and paste it from here: <a href="/data_assets/burning_daylight.txt">Chapter One Burning Daylight, by Jack London</a>. This will be used throughout the guide.

### Create a Data Collection

This section will show how to create a data collection which is essentially a folder of data files hosted on Algorithmia for free.

First create a data collection called nlp_directory:

{% highlight ruby %}
# Set your Data URI
nlp_directory = client.dir("data://your_username/nlp_directory")
# Create your data collection if it does not exist
if !(nlp_directory.exists?)
	nlp_directory.create
	puts "Created directory"
else
	puts "Error: This directory already exists"
end
{% endhighlight %}

A Data URI uniquely identifies files and directories and contains a protocol "data://" and path "your_username/data_collection". For more information on the Data URI see the [Data API Specification](http://docs.algorithmia.com/#data-api-specification).

Instead of your username you can use '.my' when calling algorithms. For more information about the '.my' pseudonym check out the [Hosted Data Guide](/application-development/data-sources/hosted-data-guide/).
