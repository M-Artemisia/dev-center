This guide provides a walk-through of how to use the official Algorithmia Python client to call algorithms and manage your data
through the Algorithmia platform.

## Getting Started with Algorithmia

Install from PyPi

The official Algorithmia python client is available on PyPi. Install it with pip:

{% highlight python %}
pip install algorithmia
{% endhighlight %}

Authentication

First, create an Algorithmia client and authenticate with your API key:

{% highlight python %}
import Algorithmia

apiKey = '{Your API key here}'
# Create the Algorithmia client
client = Algorithmia.client(apiKey)
{% endhighlight %}

Now you’re ready to call algorithms.

## Getting your Data from the Data API

[Algorithmia's Data Portal](http://developers.algorithmia.com/application-development/data-sources/) offers three different ways to store your data, all available via the [Data API](http://docs.algorithmia.com/). 

This guide will show how to work with the [Hosted Data Source](https://algorithmia.com/data/hosted) option.

To start, you can either upload your data either through the UI in the [Hosted Data Source](https://algorithmia.com/data/hosted) or via the [Data API](http://docs.algorithmia.com/).

**Note:** Before you upload your file onto Hosted Data Source, you must first create a [Data Collection](http://developers.algorithmia.com/application-development/data-sources/hosted-data-guide/)

### Uploading Data to your Data Collection

{% highlight python %}
# Upload local file
client.file("data://username/data_collection_name/jack_london.txt").putFile("/your_local_path_to_file/jack_london.txt")
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:** Instead of your username you can use '.my' when calling algorithms.

### Downloading Data to use in Algorithm
{% highlight python %}
# Download contents of file as a string
input = client.file("data://username/data_collection_name/jack_london.txt").getString()
{% endhighlight %}

## Calling algorithms

{% highlight python %}
# Create the algorithm object using the Summarizer algorithm
algo = client.algo('nlp/Summarizer/0.1.3')
# Pass in input required by algorithm
result = algo.pipe(input)
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:** a single algorithm may have different input and output types, or accept multiple types of input, so consult the algorithm’s description for usage examples specific to that algorithm.
