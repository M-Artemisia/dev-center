If you work in Scala, you can use the Algorithmia Java Client
to call algorithms and manage your data through the Algorithmia platform.

The following documentation is from the Java guide.
Additional reference documentation can be found in the [Algorithmia Client JavaDocs](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.algorithmia/algorithmia-client).
