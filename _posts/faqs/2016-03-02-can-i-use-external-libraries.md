Of course! Dependencies are added to the algorithm through the Dependencies dialog inside the algorithm editor.

In the action bar at the top of the editor, you will see the gray button labeled “Dependencies” in between the Summary button and the Save button. When you click the Dependencies button, you will see a pop-up dialog that allows you to list any external libraries that you want to import into your algorithm. This allows you to customize your algorithm as you see fit and ensures that every time the algorithm is called, all necessary libraries will be included.

You can explore [this algorithm](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/kenny/LDA/edit) as an example.
