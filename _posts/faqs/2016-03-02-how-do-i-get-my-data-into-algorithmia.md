For simple cases, you can feed the data into an algorithm at request time.

To upload data, you can use our Data API. The Data API is great for applications with larger data requirements or to batch process raw datasets.

We also offer algorithms to transfer data from Amazon S3, SQL databases, and other data sources. More data sources are being added regularly but if there is a specific data source you need, we'd love to hear from you!
