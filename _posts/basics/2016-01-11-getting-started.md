This is a quick guide to get you started using the Algorithmia API. We'll walk through how to get started with an algorithm and make your first API call.

You can follow this guide immediately by making a call on the command line via cURL. If you'd like to get up and running with another language, check out our [client guides](/clients) for instructions on how to install a language-specific client.

## Finding an Algorithm

To get started, find an algorithm you'd like to call. You can do this by using the search bar or browsing the marketplace by tags & categories. Each algorithm has an owner and an algorithm name; you'll need both to format your request. This information is listed under the algorithm name on the description page as well as in the format of the algorithm's URL.

For a given user and algorithm name, API calls are made to the following URL:

{% highlight bash %}
POST https://api.algorithmia.com/v1/algo/:owner/:algoname
{% endhighlight %}

We recommend that you also append the algorithm version in your API call to ensure that the correct algorithm is called.

## Making your first API call

We'll make our first call with the demo algorithm ["Hello"](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/demo/Hello). This algorithm takes an input of a string (preferably your name!) and returns a greeting addressed to the input.

Calling the algorithm is as simple as making a curl request. For example, to call the demo/Hello algorithm, simply run a cURL request in your terminal:

{% highlight bash lineanchors %}
curl -X POST -d '"YOUR_NAME"' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Simple YOUR_API_KEY' https://api.algorithmia.com/v1/algo/demo/Hello/0.1.1
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure to replace `YOUR_NAME` with your name & `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key.

You can also use one of the clients to make your call. See below for examples or visit one of the [client guides](/clients) for more detail specific to your language.

> cURL:

{% highlight bash lineanchors %}
curl -X POST -d 'YOUR_NAME' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Simple YOUR_API_KEY' https://api.algorithmia.com/v1/algo/demo/Hello/0.1.1
{% endhighlight %}

> Python:

{% highlight python lineanchors %}
import Algorithmia

input = "YOUR_NAME"
client = Algorithmia.client('YOUR_API_KEY')
algo = client.algo('demo/Hello/0.1.1')
print algo.pipe(input)
{% endhighlight %}

> Java:

{% highlight java lineanchors %}
import com.algorithmia.*;
import com.algorithmia.algo.*;

String input = "\"YOUR_NAME\"";
AlgorithmiaClient client = Algorithmia.client("YOUR_API_KEY");
Algorithm algo = client.algo("algo://demo/Hello/0.1.1");
AlgoResponse result = algo.pipeJson(input);
System.out.println(result.asJsonString());
{% endhighlight %}

> Scala:

{% highlight scala lineanchors %}
import com.algorithmia._
import com.algorithmia.algo._

val input = "YOUR_NAME"
val client = Algorithmia.client("YOUR_API_KEY")
val algo = client.algo("algo://demo/Hello/0.1.1")
val result = algo.pipeJson(input)
System.out.println(result.asJsonString)
{% endhighlight %}

> JavaScript:

{% highlight javascript lineanchors %}
// include the algorithmia.js library
var input = "YOUR_NAME";
Algorithmia.client("YOUR_API_KEY")
           .algo("algo://demo/Hello/0.1.1")
           .pipe(input)
           .then(function(output) {
             console.log(output);
           });
{% endhighlight %}

## Understanding the response

Each algorithm returns a response in JSON. It will include the `"result"` as well as metadata about the API call you made. The metadata will include the `content_type` as well as a duration.

{% highlight bash lineanchors %}
curl -X POST -d 'Liz' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Simple API_KEY' https://api.algorithmia.com/v1/algo/demo/Hello/0.1.1


{ "result": "Hello Liz",
  "metadata": {
     "content_type": "text",
     "duration": 0.000187722
  }
}
{% endhighlight%}

The duration is the compute time of the API call into the algorithm. This is the time in seconds between the start of the execution of the algorithm and when it produces a response. Because you are charged on the compute time of the API call, this information will help you optimize your use of the API.
