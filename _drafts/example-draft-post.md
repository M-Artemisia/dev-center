This is what a sample draft should look like!

Save the file and run Jekyll with the `--drafts` flag to preview your work.

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve -w --drafts
```

Go back to `localhost:4000` and you should see your new post listed under today’s date. Jekyll infers the post title from the filename if none is provided, and uses the file’s last-modified date as the publication date.

Now when you’ve finished a draft and decide to publish it, the process is pretty straight forward. Move the file from _drafts to _posts, add the year formatted as YYYY-MM-DD- to the start of the filename.
