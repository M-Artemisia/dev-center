# How to solve a bounty in Algortihmia

The Algorithmia Bounty system is a great way for algorithm developers to challenge themselves as well as earn credits by solving direct problems proposed by the community at large. A bounty is a direct manefestation of "demand" for a certain algorithm so there is a chance to not only earn credits by solving the bounty but also earn credits for all future use of that algorithm since it will be published to the Algorithmia Marketplace. 

The following guide will show you the algorithm developer how to find and approach solving a bounty with the highest chance of success.

1) Finding a Bounty
2) Understanding the problem
3) Creating a new algorithm
4) Completion checklist
5) Fulfilling the Bounty
6) Review process

### 1. Finding a Bounty
The first step in completing a bounty is to find a bounty to complete. You can find a complete listing of bounties here: [Algorithmia Bounties](https://algorithmia.com/bounties)

Once you find a bounty that captures your attention click on it and check on the right top panel for important information about the Bounty such as:
- User who created the bounty
- If the bounty is ```Active``` or ```Fulfilled```. 
- Days left before Bounty expires (All bounties are active for 60 days)
- The Bounty Amount in USD.

@TODO: Image of active bounty.

### 2. Understanding the Problem
It is very imporant to truelly understand the problem before attempting to fulfill a bounty. Read the bounty description carefully and request any clarifying remarks by using the discussion board available at the bottom of every bounty. The bounty author will be notified by email that there is a message that requires their attention. 

Once you beleive you have a good grasp of the problem , sample data and interface requested it is time to create a new algorithm.

### 3. Creating a new Algorithm

@TODO: Link to creating a new algorithm.

### 4. Completion check list
A quick checklist to make sure everything is in order before submitting your algorithm for review:

- Does the algorithm solve the problem stated in the bounty ?
- Has the newly created algorithm been fully documented including: description, how to use the algorithm, sample input and a generated sample output.
- Has the algorithm been tested against sample data provided (if provided)
- Have all interface requirements set out in the bounty been met?
- Has the algorithm been published publicly?

If all answers are ```YES``` then we are ready to fulfill the bounty.

### 5. Fulfilling the Bounty
Once your checklist has been completed and algorithm published you can go back to the bounty page and click the ``` FULFILL BOUNTY``` button. 

A pop-up explaining the terms and conditions of our bounty program as well as containing a drop down of all your algorithms will show up. Select the appropriate algorithm to fulfill the bounty and submit by accepting the terms and conditions.

### 6. Review process
Once a bounty submission is made , the bounty author as well as Algorithmia will receive a notification. At this time the bounty creator has 30 days to accept or reject the algorithm submittd for the bounty. 

In case of acceptance the bounty will be paid out to the algorithm developer either through Paypal (USD) or Algorithmia platform credits. The algorithm is now live on the platform.

In the case of rejection , the bounty owner is required to provide a detailed reasoning of why the algorithm does not fulfill the bounty. At this time the Algorithmia team will help by determining if the reasoning is valid or not. Per the terms and conditions Algorithmia's decision on bounty matters is final.
