Algorithmia Developer Center
========

Welcome to the repository for Algorithmia's Developer Center. Here you will find guides, tutorials, sample apps, as well as some documentation on getting started with the API and basic set up.

These docs are built on Jekyll. Learn more over at [the official Jekyll page](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Running locally
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 1.9.3 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

 1. Fork this repository on Github.
 2. Clone *your forked repository* with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/dev-center.git`
 3. `cd dev-center`
 4. Install all dependencies: `bundle install`. If you are having trouble with some of the gems, try running `bundle update`, then run `bundle install` again.
 5. Start the test server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`

You can now see the developer center at <http://localhost:4000>.


Making changes

###Project Organization

All posts, layouts, includes, stylesheets, assets, and whatever else is grouped nicely under the root folder. 

Find all posts under the `_posts` directory.

The compiled Jekyll site outputs to _site/.


### Writing Posts

The first thing that goes in each new post is the [YAML front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). Below is an example of front-matter:

```
---
layout: article
title:  "Example post!"
date:   2016-01-05 11:39:38
categories: guides example
comments: false #true by default but currently disabled in config (optional field)
share: false #true by default (optional field)
sitemap: false #true by default (optional field)
---
```

For our purposes, the minimum you will need is `layout`, `title`, `date`, & `categories`. The other fields only need to be present if you are overriding the default.

Posts are organized according to category as a subdirectory of `_posts`. Each post follows the same naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`.

Here is an example:
```
_posts/guides/2016-01-05-example-post.md
```
