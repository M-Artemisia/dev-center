To call algorithms and interact with the Data API, you'll use an API key for authenticatication.

This guide will show how to create new API keys and customize API access to suit your security needs.

## Default API key

To view your API keys, go to "Manage API Keys" under your account profile:

<images-section>
  <image-popout>
    <img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/api_keys/my_api_keys_from_profile.png" alt="My API Keys from Profile Menu" class="syn-image-responsive">
  </image-popout>
</images-section>

When you sign up for an Algorithmia account, a default API key is automatically created called: `default-key`.

This key will show up in the code snippets on an algorithm profile page when you are signed in, allowing you to easily make calls to the algorithm either through the web console or by copying the code directly to include in your program.

<images-section>
  <image-popout>
    <img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/api_keys/default-key.png" alt="API keys home" class="syn-image-responsive">
  </image-popout>
</images-section>

If you delete your `default-key`, it will no longer show up in the code snippets on the algorithm profile pages. Simply create a new key and name it `default-key` to have it appear again.

## Adding a new API key

Click the "Create New" button to the right of your username. Choose "API Key" where you'll see the following dialog box where you can name and configure your new API key:

<images-section>
  <image-popout>
    <img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/api_keys/new-simple-key.png" alt="API keys dialog" class="syn-image-responsive">
  </image-popout>
</images-section>

**Note:** If you want to create a Management API key which allows you to interact with algorithms via the CLI tool, check out the [Algorithm Management API]({{site.baseurl}}/algorithm-development/algorithm-management-api).

## Access options

Each API key can be customized to enable or restrict access depending on your needs.

**Best Practice:** each application should have a its own API key with customized settings for that application's specific use case.

### Whitelist Algorithms

One way you can restrict access is to whitelist specific algorithms that you want that API key to have access to.

Note that `algo://` is the prefix you'll need to use before the owner name and algorithm name.

Let's say that I have a project that has its own API key that I want to restrict to only call the algorithms I specify. I'll name my key after the project, then add the algorithms it can call.

If I wanted to restrict this API key to the algorithm "sentiment_analysis". I'll format the alias like this: `algo://` + the algorithm owner + the algorithm name. Thus sentiment_analysis would end ups as `algo://demos/sentiment_analysis` (where in this case the username is demos):

<images-section>
  <image-popout>
    <img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/api_keys/algo_restrictions_no_star.png" alt="caller origin" class="syn-image-responsive">
  </image-popout>
</images-section>

By default, any key can call any algorithm on the platform. You can see in the below screenshot that under the Algorithm Access section, there is an entry `algo://*`, which is highlighted. This is a wildcard that matches all of the algorithms. To make sure your key is restricted to calling only the algorithms you've specified, be sure to remove this wildcard entry by clicking on the "X" icon.

<images-section>
  <image-popout>
    <img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/api_keys/algo_restrictions.png" alt="caller origin" class="syn-image-responsive">
  </image-popout>
</images-section>

### Caller origin & hostname

Another way to customize your API key access is to restrict the permissions on where API calls can originate.

There are two options you can check in the dialog, native clients and web browser:

<images-section>
  <image-popout>
    <img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/api_keys/call_origin.png" alt="caller origin" class="syn-image-responsive">
  </image-popout>
</images-section>

If you are only calling Algorithmia through a client, you can leave that box checked and your key will work as you make API calls.

However, if you plan to use this key on a website where you will be making CORS requests, select the web browser permission.

When you check that box, another field will appear allowing for more customization:

<images-section>
  <image-popout>
    <img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/api_keys/call_origin_web.png" alt="caller origin web host" class="syn-image-responsive">
  </image-popout>
</images-section>

As you can see, when you allow cross-origin requests to use your authentication, you can restrict the access by referrer hostname. This is a security measure that allows you to say that the API key can only be used when the request is coming from your website.

### Data API Access

The third method to customize your API key access is to change its permissions relating to the Data API. By default, when you create a new API key, data access is set to "No Access".

<images-section>
  <image-popout>
    <img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/api_keys/data_none.png" alt="data default" class="syn-image-responsive">
  </image-popout>
</images-section>

You have two options to change the Data API access. You can either let your API key have permission to read only or to allow read and write access:

<images-section>
  <image-popout>
    <img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/api_keys/data_all.png" alt="data all" class="syn-image-responsive">
  </image-popout>
</images-section>

By selecting "Read Only", you've set your API key permissions to access data via the API, with no write access to your data. This is good if you have an application that needs to be able to read a trained model or data file that you've stored in order to run the algorithm, but won't be saving any data from the API call.

When you select "Read & Write", the API key will allow both read and write access to your data. For many algorithms, the results can be written to your data storage through the Data API and the API key, so both will need write permissions.

If you are trying to run an algorithm that writes to your data storage but are getting an authentication error, make sure that the API key you are using to authenticate has all the necessary permissions you need.
