Call the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/../algorithms/util/DynamoDB/">DynamoDB</a> algorithm to access data in your DynamoDB database.

This algorithm is a wrapper that allows you to scan a table in your DynamoDB database. All you have to do is create a file called "credentials.json" within a data collection called "DynamoDBCredentials" and then pass in your table name as a string. The algorithm will do a table scan of all the items in your table and return them as a JSON formatted array.
