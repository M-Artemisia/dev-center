<a href="https://algorithmia.com/data">Algorithmia's Data Portal</a> makes it easy to connect your application to data sources with connections to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon's S3 service</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> or you can host your files for free on the <a href="https://algorithmia.com/data/hosted">Algorithmia platform</a>. With these options it's easy to integrate your data into the app you're building.

How easy is it? By creating an Algorithmia account you automatically have access to <a href="https://algorithmia.com/data/hosted">Algorithmia's Hosted Data Source</a> where you can store your data or algorithm output and if you have a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> or an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> account you can configure a new data source to permit Algorithmia to read and write files on your behalf. Once you've set up your data connections all three file hosting options are accessable via <a href="http://docs.algorithmia.com/#data-api-specification">Algorithmia's Data API</a>.
