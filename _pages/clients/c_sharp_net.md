We now have an early version of a native .NET client for calling algorithms and interacting with our Data APIs.  This guide will give you a walkthrough of how to use the new .NET client.  The client is open-sourced and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/algorithmiaio/algorithmia-c-sharp).

#### Getting Started with Algorithmia in .NET
The Algorithmia client is available on NuGet.org and is as easy as adding the package to your .NET project using Visual Studio or the NuGet Packet Manager.

{% highlight csharp %}
Install-Package Algorithmia.Client
{% endhighlight %}

#### Required imports
{% highlight csharp %}
using Algorithmia;
{% endhighlight %}

#### Calling your first algorithm
Calling an algorithm is extremely simple with the .NET Client.  You first create a client using your API key.  You can find your API key at https://algorithmia.com/user#credentials.

{% highlight csharp %}
var client = new Algorithmia.Client("YOUR_API_KEY");
{% endhighlight %}

Now, you can find any algorithm in the directory at https://algorithmia.com/algorithms and call it.  In this case, we are going to call the [Hello demo algorithm](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/demo/hello).

{% highlight csharp %}
 var algo = new Algorithmia.Algorithm(client, "algo://demo/hello");
 var response = algo.pipe<string>("World");

 // Many algorithms return serialized JSON so don't forget to parse the text response
 var text = response.result.ToString();
{% endhighlight %}

A single algorithm may have different input and output types, or accept multiple types of input, so consult the algorithmâ€™s description for usage examples specific to that algorithm.

#### Specifying an On-Premises Endpoint
This .NET Client also works for customers running the [Algorithmia platform on-premises with CODEX](https://algorithmia.com/enterprise).  You can specify the API endpoint when you create the client object.  

{% highlight csharp %}
var client = new Algorithmia.Client("YOUR_API_KEY", "https://mylocalendpoint);
{% endhighlight %}

Alternately, you can ensure that each of your servers interacting with CODEX have an environment variable named `ALGORITHMIA_API` and the client will use it.  The fallback API endpoint is always the hosted Algorithmia marketplace service at https://api.algorithmia.com/.


#### Additional information
You can find out more about the .NET Client from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/algorithmiaio/algorithmia-c-sharp).  You can also find our [API Specification](http://docs.algorithmia.com/) available for all of the APIs that are available on the Algorithmia platform.
