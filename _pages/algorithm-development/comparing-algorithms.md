So you've been playing around with Algorithmia for a while, and you may have noticed a variety of algorithms that tackle the same problem, in different ways. The [Algorithmia Evaluations](https://algorithmia.com/evaluations) tool lets you compare algorithms in a bunch of different ways. 
This guide will walk you through the steps to implement your own evaluation.

**Note:** Things you should have before we begin:
- A working knowledge of [algorithm development on Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/developers/algorithm-development/).
- A type of algorithm you want to evaluate (image classification, character recognition, etc).
- Some criteria you want to compare your algorithms with.

Got all that? Great! Lets dive in.

## Step 1: Find your evaluation data

- If your evaluation requires labelled data comparison, make sure you have the data available and formatted for use in the [data API](https://algorithmia.com/data).

## Step 2: Create an Evaluation (evaluator) algorithm.
- An evaluator algorithm is special type of algorithm that compares similar algorithms based on some kind of criteria.
    - Example criteria:
        - Comparing label accuracy of different image classifiers, on an image dataset.
        - Comparing performance of different string reversal techniques.
- For guidance on how to create your own evaluator algorithm, check out [String Reversal Evaluator Algorithm](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/zeryx/evaluator/edit), the algorithm is public and is a great starting point!
- Other things to keep in mind:
    - Make sure that your evaluation algorithm is owned by a user, not an org.
    - Make sure to publish your algorithm before using it.

## Step 3: Go to www.algorithmia.com/evaluations and create a new evaluation

- Make sure that you don't create under an organization, there is an open issue with org owned evaluations.
## Step 4: Setup your Evaluation
### Step 4.1: Add your evaluator algorithm at the bottom, click "Choose Existing".

- If you can't find your evaluator, make sure its:
    - A [published algorithm](https://algorithmia.com/developers/algorithm-development/algorithm-basics/your-first-algo/#publish-your-algorithm)
    - Visible to your user account
    - Not created by an Organization (for now)

### Step 4.2: Add your Evaluatable Algorithms

-  If you can't find Evaluatable Algorithm, make sure its:
    - A [published algorithm](https://algorithmia.com/developers/algorithm-development/algorithm-basics/your-first-algo/#publish-your-algorithm)
    - Visible to your user account 
### Step 4.3: Provide an input to your evaluator algorithm

![](https://i.imgur.com/90L7OH5.png)
- Things to keep in mind about your evaluator algorithm's input:
    - it must be a json object
    - Remember that the `evaluated_algorithm` input variable defined in the Evaluator Algorithm is passed automatically.
    - Any additional parameters you wish to provide to your evaluatable algorithms should be passed here, in the evaluation input.
## Step 5: Run your Evaluation

![](https://i.imgur.com/xoq8mKe.png)
- Once your input is ready, you can click the big "run evaluation" button at the top
- Once your evaluation is executing, you can click the "results" tab and check the results.
- If any errors or exceptions are detected during algorithm execution, they'll be declared in the `Error` column on the far right.

And by following this guide, you should be able to create virtually any kind of evaluation!
