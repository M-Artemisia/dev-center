Welcome to hosting your <a href="https://https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit">CNTK</a> model on Algorithmia!
This guide is designed as an introduction to hosting your CNTK model and publishing an algorithm, even if you've never used Algorithmia before!


# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you'll need to pick which [python wheel][whl] first! We support all wheel versions,
but you should select the wheel that is designed for your version of python.

## Train and save your model

## Create a Data Collection

## Upload your Model into a Collection

# Create your Algorithm

## set your dependencies

# Load your Model

# Preloading Function

# Complete Example

# Publishing your Algorithm

# Working Demo
