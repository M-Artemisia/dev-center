Algorithmia supports algorithm development in JavaScript.

#### Available APIs

Algorithmia makes a number of libraries available to make algorithm development easier.
The full <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/">Javascript Node language and standard library</a>
is available for you to use in your algorithms. Furthermore, algorithms can call other algorithms and manage data on the Algorithmia platform
via the <a href="http://developers.algorithmia.com/application-development/client-guides/javascript/">Algorithmia Javascript Client</a>.

#### Managing Dependencies

Algorithmia supports adding 3rd party dependencies via the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM Javascript package manager</a> using a package.json file. On the algorithm editor page, click Options and select Manage Dependencies.

Add dependencies by including the package name and version to the `package.json` file.


`"dependencies": {
	"algorithmia": "0.3.x",
 	"lodash": "4.11.2"
 }`


**Note:** that you will still need to import your package to your algorithm file. For example to include your package 'lodash' add:

`lodash = require("lodash")();`

#### I/O for Your Algorithms:

Datatypes that are either sequences that you don't wish to iterate over such as strings, or inputs that are scalar in nature such as numeric data types can be accessed via input, however you will probably want to check for the data type you are expecting to receive.

{% highlight javascript %}
exports.apply = function(input, cb) {
	if (typeof input == String){
    	cb(null, input);
    }
};
{% endhighlight %}

A string input:

{% highlight javascript %}
input_string = "~3.14159"
{% endhighlight %}

Inputs that are sequences such as: arrays, objects and buffers (binary buffer sequence such as an image file) can be handled as you would any JavaScript sequence. For example:

{% highlight javascript %}
exports.apply = function(input, cb) {
	if (typeof input == Array){
	    cb(null, "A few of the most starred node.js packages: " + input[0] + ", " + input[1] + ", " + input[2]);
	}
};
{% endhighlight %}

Here is an example of an array input:

{% highlight javascript %}
input_array = ["express", "gulp", "async"]
{% endhighlight %}

Which will return:

`"A few of the most starred node.js packages: express, gulp, async"`

When you are creating an algorithm be mindful of the data types you require from the user and the output you return to them. Our advice is to create algorithms that allow a few options for input such as a file or a sequence.

#### Error Handling

{% highlight javascript %}
try {
	x = parseInt(input)
} catch (error) {
	// Where cb is a callback function passed into your apply method
	throw cb(error, input)
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Calling Other Algorithms and Managing Data

To call other algorithms or manage data from your algorithm, use the <a href="http://developers.algorithmia.com/application-development/client-guides/javascript/">Algorithmia Javascript Client</a> which is automatically available to any algorithm you create on the Algorithmia platform.

When designing your algorithm, don't forget that there are special data directories, `.session` and `.algo`, that are available only to algorithms to help you manage data over the course of the algorithm execution.
