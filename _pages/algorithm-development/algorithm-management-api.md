Using the Algorithm Management APIs, you can create, publish, update, and inspect individual algorithms.

For the full specification, see the [Algorithm Management API doc](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6515899/Rztiuqao) or the "algorithms" section of the official [OpenAPI Spec](https://algorithmia.com/v1/openapispec)

Note that there are two different types of API Keys, used with different endpoints.  All Algorithm Management APIs use Simple API Keys, which can be created at {{site.url}}/user#credentials.  Ensure that the Key you are using has the checkbox "Allow this key to manage my algorithms" checked:
