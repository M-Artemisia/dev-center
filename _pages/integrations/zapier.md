[Zapier](https://zapier.com) lets you create workflows, called Zaps, which are triggered by one provider -- for example, a file being added to Dropbox or S3 -- and cause an action to performed elsewhere, such as sending a message in GMail or Slack.

Algorithmia plays nicely with Zapier, allowing you to easily trigger Algorithms from Zapier (for example, monitoring an S3 bucket for new images, then calling [ColorfulImageColorization](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/deeplearning/ColorfulImageColorization) to create colorized versions of them), or add Machine Learning into the middle of a larger workflow (such as monitoring Zendesk for messages, passing them through [KeywordExtraction](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/cindyxiaoxiaoli/KeywordExtraction) to figure out which topics are most relevant, then sending text messages to oncall support staff for the most important ones).
