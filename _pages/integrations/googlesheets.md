[Google Sheets](http://sheets.google.com) is a collaborative, extensible online spreadsheet tool (similar to MS Excel).

Thanks to a new integration by [Ken Burcham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenburcham/), non-developers can now run Algorithmia's many machine learning and utility algorithms directly from within their Google Sheets, by simply clicking a drop-down and selecting the function they need.

It is now incredibly easy to perform complex actions such as detecting sentiment on text cells, extracting emails from webpages directly into a column, or running any other algorithm to analyze or extract information right from within your spreadsheet.
